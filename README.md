Max C.

Hello! I am Max, a highschool student with a love for learning of all sorts - machine, deep, or academic. I generally work on python machine learning projects, though I do know numerous other languages. My main project currently is an optimizer for Tensorflow/Keras designed to reduce model collapse substatially on Reinforcement tasks. The repo is called Max_AI, but the optimzier is Adalpha. 
I am currently learning all that I can about large language models and I hope to crack into MMMs soon if I can. I am limited by my singular RTX 3060 GPU, but I consider it a blessing in disguise, as it teaches / forces me to write memory optimized code. Upon request, I can work on porting Adalpha to Pytorch as that is what I mainly use now, but I simply do not have the time to do it fruitlessly.
I am looking for internships in Northern Nevada, Reno, Carson City, Sparks, etc.
Enjoy!


Check back soon. I am on the verge of something big.
